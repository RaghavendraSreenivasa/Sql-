**Project Title: Customer Data Analysis for Enhanced Banking Insights**  

This project focuses on analyzing customer data to derive valuable insights that enhance decision-making for banking services. The dataset includes key attributes such as CustomerID, personal details (FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth), contact information (Email, Phone), account details (Account_Type, Account_Open_Date, Account Number), and Employment_Status. The objective is to perform data cleaning, validation, and analysis to ensure data quality and uncover meaningful trends.  

Key tasks include identifying missing or invalid data, calculating customer ages, segmenting customers by demographics and account types, and analyzing employment status correlations. Additionally, insights on customer retention, account longevity, and trends in account openings are explored.  

This analysis will help the bank optimize marketing strategies, improve customer segmentation, and enhance product offerings by understanding customer behaviors and needs. The results can be integrated into visual dashboards for strategic planning and actionable insights.
